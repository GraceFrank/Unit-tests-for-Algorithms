two consecutive index in the array.
the first array returned should hold the difference if it is even.
the second array returned should hold the difference if it is odd. 
 


Example
function([1,2,5,6,8,10]) returns [[2], [1,1,]]
function(([3,1])) returns ([ [ 2 ], [] ])
<<<<<<< HEAD
function([-2,0,-3,-5])) returns ([ [], [-1, 5] ])


=======
function([-2,0,-3,-5])) returns ([ [], [-1, 5] ])
