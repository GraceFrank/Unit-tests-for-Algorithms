Create a function that takes in an array and returns an array of two arrays.
The function should arrange it argument in ascending order, and find the difference between 
two consecutive index in the array.
the first array returned should hold the difference if it is even.
the second array returned should hold the difference if it is odd. 
 


Example
function([1,2,5,6,8,10]) returns [[2], [1,1,]]
function(([3,1])) returns ([ [ 2 ], [] ])
function([-2,0,-3,-5])) returns ([ [], [-1, 5] ])
